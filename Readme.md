# Reflection Questions 

1. Why was it important to re-format the data from the Useless Facts API before sending it to your own client? What are the benefits of an API providing a clean, minimal response?


2. In the catch block, why is it better to send a generic error message to the client instead of the actual error object from axios?


3. How might you modify this application to get a fact in a different language if the external API supported it (e.g., with a query parameter like ?language=de)?
